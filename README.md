# Advent of code 2022

In this repository I will be leaving the codes and results of the 2022 Advent of Code.

I will, to the extent possible, not use very strange libraries or very complex functions to solve the challenges. My idea is to do it mainly with the language's own functions and the most used ones. In this way, I aim for the code to be more readable and understandable, even if there may be other solutions that are shorter or better performing.
